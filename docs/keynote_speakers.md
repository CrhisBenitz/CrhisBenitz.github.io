    talktitle: “Joyce, Borges, and Parasitic Posthumanism”
    talkabstract: In his seminal 1967 <i>Of Grammatology,</i> Jacques Derrida defines his major figure of the "supplement" as a parasitic form of thinking&#58; "the supplement is nothing, it has no proper energy, no spontaneous movement. It is a parasitic organism, an imagination or representation which determines and orients the force of desire." He suggests that Jean-Jacques Rousseau thinks of writing as a “simple ‘supplement to the spoken word’”, and makes his radical claim&#58; “Either writing was never a simple ‘supplement’, or it is urgently necessary to construct a new logic of the ‘supplement’. It is this logic that will guide us further in reading Rousseau”. In Derrida’s later landmark essay, “Signature, Event, Context”, this figure of speech returns in revised form as the West’s “logic of the parasite”. Derrida argues that the West has evolved a false logic that situates writing as supplemental or secondary to speaking, and proceeds to attack this logocentrism as the core of what he calls the West’s misguided “metaphysics of presence”. This critique of the parasitic logic of Western metaphysics in Derrida’s thought is central to later articulations of posthumanist thinking, including those of Michel Serres, Niklas Luhmann, and Cary Wolfe. Indeed, it may not be unfitting to describe this branch of the field as “parasitic posthumanism”. <br><br> What I claim in this paper is that James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges share a remarkable preoccupation with the metaphysics of parasitism in art and thought, and that this preoccupation is a kind of precursor to parasitic posthumanism. As I have argued elsewhere, Joyce explores the figure of the parasite in a variety of ways&#58; in the human forms of spongers and thieves; in the nonhuman forms of lice and syphilis; and in the metaphysical forms of intertextuality and metempsychosis. Although many valuable comparative studies of Joyce and Borges have been published, this paper will analyze for the first time the posthumanist implications of Borges’s biological conception of literary history as a “living labyrinth” and of literary immortality as a parasitic entity that “fastens upon souls like a root”—and the usefulness of these notions for understanding Borges’ metaphysics of parasitism in relation to Joyce’s.
