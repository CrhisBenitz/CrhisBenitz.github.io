    bio: James Ramey received his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Film Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2007. He is Full Professor in the Humanities Department at the Metropolitan Autonomous University, Cuajimalpa Campus (UAM-C), in Mexico City. He heads up the Master’s and Doctoral program “Literature and Film” for the UAM-C and is the campus coordinator of the Writing Across the Curriculum program. He has been a member of Mexico´s National System of Researchers (SNI) since 2010 and is chair of the Research Group "Expression and Representation", as well as of the international film studies network "Red de Cuerpos Académicos que investigan sobre Cine (Red CACINE)". He has published more than fifteen refereed book chapters and articles in journals including <em>Comparative Literature</em>, <em>James Joyce Quarterly</em>, <em>Comparative Literature Studies</em>, <em>The Latin Americanist</em>, <em>Nabokov Online Journal</em>, <em>College Literature</em>, <em>Bulletin of Spanish Studies</em>, and <em>Studies in Spanish and Latin American Cinemas</em>. His most recent co-edited volumes are <em>México imaginado&#58; Nuevos enfoques sobre el cine (trans)nacional</em> (CONACULTA-UAM, 2011) and <em>Mexican Transnational Cinema and Literature</em> (Peter Lang, 2017). In 2004 he received the A. Owen Aldridge Prize for an essay on Vladimir Nabokov´s <em>Pale Fire</em> from the American Comparative Literature Association. In 2014 he founded the Center for Writing and Argumentation of the UAM-C, the first writing center at a public university in Mexico. In 2016 he became coordinating editor of the Peter Lang book series, "Transamerican Film and Literature". He is currently writing a book called <em>Micro-Modernism&#58; Parasitic Textuality and Posthumanism</em>, a study of intertextuality conceived as a form of parasitism in works by James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov and Luis Buñuel. He was a member of the Organizing Committee of "Joyce Without Borders", the 2019 North American James Joyce Symposium, held in Mexico City in June, 2019.
    talktitle: “Joyce, Borges, and Parasitic Posthumanism”
    talkabstract: In his seminal 1967 <i>Of Grammatology,</i> Jacques Derrida defines his major figure of the "supplement" as a parasitic form of thinking&#58; "the supplement is nothing, it has no proper energy, no spontaneous movement. It is a parasitic organism, an imagination or representation which determines and orients the force of desire." He suggests that Jean-Jacques Rousseau thinks of writing as a “simple ‘supplement to the spoken word’”, and makes his radical claim&#58; “Either writing was never a simple ‘supplement’, or it is urgently necessary to construct a new logic of the ‘supplement’. It is this logic that will guide us further in reading Rousseau”. In Derrida’s later landmark essay, “Signature, Event, Context”, this figure of speech returns in revised form as the West’s “logic of the parasite”. Derrida argues that the West has evolved a false logic that situates writing as supplemental or secondary to speaking, and proceeds to attack this logocentrism as the core of what he calls the West’s misguided “metaphysics of presence”. This critique of the parasitic logic of Western metaphysics in Derrida’s thought is central to later articulations of posthumanist thinking, including those of Michel Serres, Niklas Luhmann, and Cary Wolfe. Indeed, it may not be unfitting to describe this branch of the field as “parasitic posthumanism”. <br><br> What I claim in this paper is that James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges share a remarkable preoccupation with the metaphysics of parasitism in art and thought, and that this preoccupation is a kind of precursor to parasitic posthumanism. As I have argued elsewhere, Joyce explores the figure of the parasite in a variety of ways&#58; in the human forms of spongers and thieves; in the nonhuman forms of lice and syphilis; and in the metaphysical forms of intertextuality and metempsychosis. Although many valuable comparative studies of Joyce and Borges have been published, this paper will analyze for the first time the posthumanist implications of Borges’s biological conception of literary history as a “living labyrinth” and of literary immortality as a parasitic entity that “fastens upon souls like a root”—and the usefulness of these notions for understanding Borges’ metaphysics of parasitism in relation to Joyce’s.
