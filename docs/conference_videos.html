        "Joyce in Latin America": 2019 International Conference, jointly organized by UNAM and the Irish Embassy in Mexico, took place on 10th and 11th June, 2019. We are delighted to share here the links to the full recordings of each day of this event, with the original audio in English. We wish to thank participants in this conference for their permission to share these materials with writers, scholars, students and readers from all over the world, and hope everyone enjoys the multidirectional conversations that were held on Joyce legacy, on contemporary Irish and Latin American literatures and the announcement of the "Eavan Boland - Anne Enright Irish Studies Chair" at UNAM, for which we are especially indebted to Ms Sarah Casey (Eavan Boland's Estate) and Ms. Anne Enright.
